# heroku_test

* Test cases can be found in the feature file that uses the Gherkin language 
* Automation framework written in Ruby using Capybara and RSpec 

The test approach to this framework is pretty straightforward in the sense that the manual test cases are documented using 
Gherkin. This allows for non-programmers to run the tests without needing to know any of the code and enables the documentation to come hand in hand with the automation.
